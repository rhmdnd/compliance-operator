  description: Custom security checks for OpenShift Virtualization
  enableRules:
    - kind: CustomRule
      name: kubevirt-disable-downward-metrics
      rationale: |-
        Enabling the downwardMetrics feature introduces the risk of
        unauthorized or unintended sharing of information, as well as
        manipulation of information flow restrictions. The additional metrics
        include sensitive performance data, which could aid in the
        reconnaissance activities of a malicious actor.
    - kind: CustomRule
      name: kubevirt-nonroot-feature-gate-is-enabled
      rationale: |-
        Unauthorized access to a root account without restrictions implemented
        by the nonRoot feature introduces the risk of unintended or
        unauthorized access to privilege elevation and the ability to perform
        administrative tasks.
    - kind: CustomRule
      name: kubevirt-no-permitted-host-devices
      rationale: |-
        Host devices should not be permitted to virtualization workloads unless
        absolutely necessary. Allowing host devices provides direct access to
        host hardware, which can introduce security risks including
        unauthorized access to sensitive hardware resources and potential
        privilege escalation.
    - kind: CustomRule
      name: kubevirt-persistent-reservation-disabled
      rationale: |-
        The persistent reservation feature gate should be disabled unless
        explicitly required. This feature allows VMs to claim exclusive access
        to storage resources, potentially impacting availability and enabling
        resource manipulation outside normal access controls.
